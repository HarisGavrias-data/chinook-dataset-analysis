# Chinook Customer Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior, revenue trends, and purchasing patterns using the Chinook relational database. The goal is to extract business insights using SQL queries that simulate real-world data analysis tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset is the Chinook database, which represents a digital media store with multiple related tables including:

- Customers
- Invoices
- InvoiceItems
- Tracks
- Albums
- Artists
- Genres

This structure allows complex relational queries similar to real company databases.
